## üî¨ Detailed Performance Analysis

### 1. PutOptimized: Non-Blocking Channel Operations

#### Original Implementation
```go
func (b *Batcher[T]) Put(item *T, _ ...int) {
    b.ch <- item  // Always blocks when channel is full
}
```

#### Optimized Implementation
```go
func (b *Batcher[T]) PutOptimized(item *T, _ ...int) {
    select {
    case b.ch <- item:
        // Fast path - non-blocking send succeeded
    default:
        // Channel is full, fallback to blocking send
        b.ch <- item
    }
}
```

**Why It's Faster:**
- Attempts non-blocking send first, avoiding goroutine suspension when a channel has space
- Reduces context switching overhead in high-throughput scenarios
- Maintains same behavior (blocking when necessary) but optimizes the common case

### 2. WorkerOptimized: Timer Reuse Pattern

#### Original Implementation
```go
func (b *Batcher[T]) worker() {
    for {
        expire := time.After(b.timeout)  // Creates new timer each iteration
        // ... rest of loop
    }
}
```

#### Optimized Implementation
```go
func (b *Batcher[T]) workerOptimized() {
    timer := time.NewTimer(b.timeout)
    defer timer.Stop()
    
    for {
        timer.Reset(b.timeout)  // Reuses existing timer
        // ... rest of loop
    }
}
```

**Why It's Faster:**
- Eliminates timer allocation on each batch cycle
- Reduces garbage collection pressure
- Timer reuse is a documented Go best practice for hot paths

### 3. WithPool: sync.Pool for Batch Slice Reuse

#### Original Implementation
```go
// Creates new slice for each batch
batch := make([]T, 0, b.batchSize)
```

#### Optimized Implementation
```go
type WithPool[T any] struct {
    *Batcher[T]
    pool *sync.Pool
}

// Get slice from pool
batch := b.pool.Get().([]T)
defer func() {
    batch = batch[:0]  // Reset slice
    b.pool.Put(batch)  // Return to pool
}()
```

**Why It's Faster:**
- Reuses allocated memory across batches
- Dramatically reduces allocations in high-frequency scenarios
- sync.Pool is optimized for per-CPU caching

### 4. GetOptimized: Smart Search Order

#### Original Implementation
```go
func (m *TimePartitionedMap) Get(key string) (value, bool) {
    // Map iteration order is random
    for _, bucket := range m.buckets {
        if val, exists := bucket.data[key]; exists {
            return val, true
        }
    }
    return value{}, false
}
```

#### Optimized Implementation
```go
func (m *TimePartitionedMapOptimized) GetOptimized(key string) (value, bool) {
    // Search from newest to oldest bucket
    for i := len(m.buckets) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
        if val, exists := m.buckets[i].data[key]; exists {
            return val, true
        }
    }
    return value{}, false
}
```

**Why It's Faster:**
- Most lookups are for recently added items (temporal locality)
- Predictable search order improves CPU cache utilization
- Avoid random map iteration overhead

### 5. SetOptimized: Bloom Filter for Fast Deduplication

#### Original Implementation
```go
func (m *TimePartitionedMap) Set(key string, val value) {
    if _, exists := m.Get(key); !exists {  // Always does full search
        bucket.data[key] = val
    }
}
```

#### Optimized Implementation
```go
func (m *TimePartitionedMapOptimized) SetOptimized(key string, val value) {
    // Fast negative check with Bloom filter
    if !m.bloomFilter.Contains(key) {
        bucket.data[key] = val
        m.bloomFilter.Add(key)
        return
    }
    
    // Only do full search if Bloom filter says "maybe exists"
    if _, exists := m.GetOptimized(key); !exists {
        bucket.data[key] = val
        m.bloomFilter.Add(key)
    }
}
```

**Why It's Faster:**
- Bloom filters provide O(1) negative lookups with no false negatives
- Avoid expensive map searches for new items
- Small memory overhead (one bit per item with optimal parameters)
- Enhanced with type-specific hash functions for all Go comparable types

| BloomFilter        | Test operation  | 26.85 ns/op | 24 B/op, 1 alloc |

### Bloom Filter Type-Specific Performance

The bloom filter now includes optimized hash functions for all Go comparable types:

| Type               | Performance     | Allocations      | Notes                            |
|--------------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Bool               | 34.00 ns/op     | 32 B/op, 2 alloc | Fastest - single byte hash      |
| Int/Uint64         | 49.88 ns/op     | 40 B/op, 3 alloc | Optimized binary encoding       |
| Float64            | 52.10 ns/op     | 40 B/op, 3 alloc | IEEE 754 binary representation  |
